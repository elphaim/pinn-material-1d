# pinn-material-1d

This repo contains the code used to explore various PINN optimization techniques. It focuses on the 1d heat equation as a starting point, and will later move on to more complex/useful PDEs once the optimization techniques are implemented correctly. See the pdf in the root folder for some results and findings.
